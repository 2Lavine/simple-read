## SCA software compositon analysis
- automated process that identifies the open source software in a codebase.

## SAST Static application security testing  
- used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.
- It’s in this stage of static code analysis that developers can code, test, revise, 
and test again

## DAST dynamic
- a black box testing method ,do not have access to the source code
- attempt to detect vulnerabilities in configuration issues,environment issues
- find mistaks at the end of SDLC
- 
- but time consuming ,slow scans 
- normally only web application

## Vulnerability Assessment 漏洞评估
- determining the  vulnerability of  assets at risk of being lost, taken, damaged, or  destroyed.
- flow： Definition Identifiton Analysis
- VA 可以包括静态分析、动态测试、漏洞扫描、渗透测试等多种技术和方法。
