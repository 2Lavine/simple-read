OpenTelemetry

Observability is crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior and performance of your Next.js app.

We recommend using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting your apps

Next.js supports OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, which means that we already instrumented Next.js itself.

When you enable OpenTelemetry we will automatically wrap all your code like getStaticProps in spans with helpful attributes.
