Why TypeScript?

tRPC

tRPC delivers on GraphQL’s promise of seamless client development against a typesafe server without all of the boilerplate. It’s a clever abuse of TypeScript that provides an incredible dev experience.

Prisma

Prisma is to SQL what TypeScript is to JS.

By generating types from a user-defined schema compatible with several databases↗,

Prisma guarantees end-to-end typesafety from your database to your app.

Prisma provides a whole suite of tools↗ making daily interactions with your database easier.

Prisma Client is responsible for querying and making SQL so easy you’ll barely notice you’re using it

Prisma Studio is a convenient GUI for your database that lets you read and manipulate your data quickly without having to write code

Tailwind CSS

with its inline-like approach, Tailwind encourages you to style without worrying about naming classes, organizing files, or any other issue not directly tied to the problem you’re trying to solve
