Nuemark is designed for content creation

Built-in set of headless UI components

All these components or “tags” are headless — meaning that there are no inline styling, CSS modules, or utility classes to impact their appearance

Driven by Web Components

Nuemark uses the standard is attribute to tell the browser that a particular HTML structure should be spiced up with a Web Component

Any JavaScript object with a name property and render() method is a legit Nuemark component.
